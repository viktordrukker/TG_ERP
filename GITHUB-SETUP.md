# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these instructions to create a GitHub repository and push your initial commit:

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Enter repository name: `TG_ERP`
3. Add a description: `Telegram-integrated Enterprise Resource Planning System`
4. Choose "Public" or "Private" as per your preference
5. **DO NOT** initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect your local repository to GitHub

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/TG_ERP.git

# Verify the remote was added successfully
git remote -v
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## 3. Push your code to GitHub

```bash
# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If you're using GitHub authentication with a personal access token, you may be prompted to enter your credentials.

## 4. Creating a Pull Request (optional)

If you want to follow a proper PR workflow from the start:

1. Create a new branch for development:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b develop
   ```

2. Push this branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin develop
   ```

3. Go to the GitHub repository in your browser
4. Click on "Compare & pull request" button
5. Set the base branch to `main` and the compare branch to `develop`
6. Add a title: "Initial project structure and setup"
7. Add a description detailing what this PR includes:
   ```
   This PR establishes the foundational structure for the TG_ERP project:

   - Basic repository structure with services, docker, docs, and scripts folders
   - Microservices architecture with Auth Service and API Gateway
   - Documentation including README, CONTRIBUTING guidelines, and developer guide
   - Docker-based local development environment
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration with GitHub Actions
   - Deployment strategy for staging and production environments
   ```
8. Click "Create pull request"

## 5. Next Steps

After creating the PR, you can:

- Review the code changes in the PR
- Set up GitHub repository settings (branch protection, collaborators, etc.)
- Configure GitHub Secrets for CI/CD (DOCKERHUB_USERNAME, DOCKERHUB_TOKEN, etc.)
- Implement additional microservices following the established pattern
